  <h2 id="headsup">prepare</h2>
  <p id="laga"> 1. Pat beef dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper<br>2. Sear Beef: Heat 1 tbsp olive oil over high heat in a heavy<br>based pot. Add beef and sear each piece aggressively on all<br>sides until very browned (3 - 5 minutes in total), then remove onto a plate.<br>
    3. Turn stove down to medium low and add remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil.<br>4.Soffrito: Add garlic and onion and sauté for 2 minutes.<br>Then add the carrots and celery and sauté slowly for 5 minutes.<br>
    5. Add remaining Ragu ingredients and return the beef to the pot (including pooled juices)<br>Turn the stove up and bring it to a simmer, then turn it down to low so it's bubbling very very gently. (Note 7)<br>
    6. Slow cook: Cover the pot and let it cook for 2 hours or until beef is tender<br>enough to shred. (Note 5 for slow cooker and pressure cooker).<br>
    7. Shred: Remove beef then coarsely shred with 2 forks. Return beef to the pot.<br>Simmer for 30 minutes until sauce is reduced and thickened - beef will soften<br>slightly more during this step.<br>
    8. Final season: Do a taste test and adjust the seasoning to your taste with salt<br>and pepper. ALSO, add 1/2 tsp sugar if sauce is a bit sour for your taste (Note 6).<br>Place the lid on and set aside until ready to serve (it's even better the next<br>day and freezes well for months!).<br>

  <h2>history behind ragu</h2>
  <p>
    Nowadays Ragù Bolognese is one of the best known and most famous recipes in the world. Especially famous in Italy, it has spread abroad thanks to Italian immigrants who brought with them the flavors of their native land. There are countless international variations, such as Spaghetti Bolognese, an American transposition of the original recipe.
